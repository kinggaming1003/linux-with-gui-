I've provided a single block of code that should resolve all the syntax errors shown in your recent screenshots. The common issues you've faced were:
* **Missing colons**: The key `"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/desktop-lite:1"` was not followed by a colon.
* **Missing commas**: The closing braces of objects and arrays were missing commas to separate them from the next entry.
* **Trailing comma**: The last item in a JSON object or array should not have a comma after it.

This corrected file has all the necessary elements and correct syntax. Once you update your file with this code, remember to rebuild your Codespace to apply the changes.
