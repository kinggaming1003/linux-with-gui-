# Name of the workflow as it appears in the GitHub Actions tab
name: Node.js CI/CD

# Define when the workflow should run
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Triggers on pushes to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Triggers on pull requests targeting the main branch

# Define the jobs that make up this workflow
jobs:
  build:
    # The type of machine (runner) to run the job on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      # This is crucial for accessing your code within the runner's environment
      - name: Checkout repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the specific version of Node.js
      # This makes 'node' and 'npm' commands available in the PATH
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Specify your desired Node.js version

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      # 'npm ci' is often preferred over 'npm install' in CI environments for deterministic installs
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Build the project (if applicable)
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # Optional Step: Upload build artifacts (e.g., your compiled application)
      # This makes the build output available for subsequent jobs (like deployment)
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-output
          path: dist # Replace 'dist' with your actual build output directory
